* Hue Light Control
This repository includes several scripts to control Philips Hue Lights from your command line. They are written in Python and use the module [[https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue][phue]].

Initial examples taken from the module documentation. They might evolve overtime :)

** Setup instructions
Find the IP Address of your bridge using the mobile or desktop app. Edit lights_on.py and lights_off.py to add the IP and control your lights.

Note: Before running every script for the first time you need to press the button on the Bridge to authenticate.
